API RenderFlex is a versatile **WordPress plugin designed to fetch and display data from external APIs with ease.** Whether you're pulling in content from third-party services or custom APIs, this plugin gives you full control over how the data is rendered. Built-in support for both Gutenberg blocks and shortcodes, developers and site owners can easily customize the output using filters and hooks, making it reusable for a wide range of APIs and use cases. Perfect for those who want flexible, dynamic API integration without sacrificing customization.

### PHP Classes

Classes are automatically loaded by the Init class with the method **register_classes_list**:

```
    /**
	 * Loop through the classes list, initialize them,
	 * and call the initialize() method if it exists
	 */
	public static function register_classes_list() {
		foreach ( self::classes_list() as $class ) {
			$classname = self::instantiate( $class );
			if ( method_exists( $classname, 'initialize' ) ) {
				$classname->initialize();
			}
		}
	}
```

To add your new classes, make sure add them to the array present in the method **classes_list**:

```
	/**
	 * Store the classes inside an array
	 *
	 * @return array Full list of classes
	 */
	public static function classes_list() {
		return [
			Plugin::class,
            YourNewClass::class,
		];
	}
```
